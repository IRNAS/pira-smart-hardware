## Features

* Single cell LiPo cell charging of up to 3A (multiple 18650 cells supported) + LifePo4 support
* Solar panel charging (Voltaic systems 6W panels in parallel recommended)
* USB charging, compatible with QI wireless chargers
* Advanced current limiting, to support wide array of chargers
* Precise charging control via i2c (BQ24296)
* Battery temperature protection with thermistor
* Battery reverse polarity protection and fuse (3A)
* High-current battery output mosfet (for 3G or satellite modems)
* LoRa RMF95 communication module
* Nordic nRF51822 based BLE device for FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air update) and control (MDBT40)
* Advanced power scheduling for robust applications:
  * ISL1208 RTC for configurable scheduled boot and timekeeping, with battery backup power supply to save power of the main battery
  * configurable power-up sources (RTC, charging, etc.)
